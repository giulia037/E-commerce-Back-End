## Description
For this assignment we were supposed to use insomnia to create post request and get requests. I found most of my reference to this assignment in activity 26 and our practice project activity 28. I started by collecting all of the files I needed by looking back on past assignments. After that I started looking at the to dos and I compared the files and filled in the blanks. After that I made sure the data was calling the apis and seeds I needed it to. After that I was able to run the code. However once I ran the code I noticed a few bugs. I was ble to fix a few of them, but I was not able to fix the delete function.
